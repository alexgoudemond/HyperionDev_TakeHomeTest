# HyperionDev_TakeHomeTest_SectionC

This folder contains the answer to Section C of the Take-Home Test, and is the solution to the code challenge suggested by HyperionDev. The code challenge chosen was outlined in **edabit**, titled [International Standard Book Numbers](https://edabit.com/challenge/C5mooK3wfdhoooeLw).

The coding language chosen for this code challenge is Python

---

To detail the progress of my solution, I chose to implement the solution in a Jupyter Notebook, with VS Code. This will also allow the author to describe the problem statement in more detail, and show the progression into the answer. Thereafter, the author will take the key insights from the Jupyter Notebook and insert them into a seperate python file, to allow for user interaction
