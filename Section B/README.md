# HyperionDev_TakeHomeTest_SectionB

This folder contains the answer to Section B of the Take-Home Test provided by the HyperionDev Take-Home Test.

I would like to post a URL to a Github project I am most proud of, and kindly refer the reader to my [Image Processing GUI in Python](https://github.com/alexgoudemond/ImageProcessingAlex).

The reason that I am proud of this project is because this project represented a labour of love, completed in my honours year at UKZN. One of my modules was Image Processing, and the structure of the module was such that every week we have an hour meeting, where we discussed the theory of Image Processing. We then encouraged to apply the knowledge practically, in our own time.

I chose to implement this with a GUI in Python, and this labour of love represents my efforts to apply all of the theory learned in my Image Processing Course at UKZN. The insights from the project also assisted me with another project - my main Honours Project - however this Image Processing GUI is one I am particularly proud of.

It is not perfect! There are many opportunities for refinement, optimization, improving readability, making things more responsive and scalable, etc. However, I am proud to show what I was able to achieve, in my free time whilst studying.

The project is based in Python, and makes use of: OpenCV, Tkinter, Matplotlib, NumPy, sci-kit-learn, and others.
